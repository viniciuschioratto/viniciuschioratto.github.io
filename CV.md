# Professional Summary

I am a software engineer with a degree in Computer Science and over 6 years of experience in software development, with a primary focus on back-end technologies. My expertise lies in Java and frameworks like the Spring Project, where I design and implement scalable, robust, and high-performance solutions. I also bring experience in front-end development using frameworks such as React and Angular, allowing me to contribute across the entire stack when needed.

In addition to hands-on development, I have experience leading projects as a tech lead, guiding teams to deliver successful outcomes while ensuring technical quality. My skill set includes knowledge of testing techniques, DevOps practices, and software architecture, which I leverage to create reliable, maintainable, and efficient systems.

With a strong foundation in containerization tools like Docker, orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, and cloud services like AWS, I deliver solutions that are optimized for performance and scalability, ensuring technical excellence and adaptability to diverse project requirements.
